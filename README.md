# jsTaskPlan
Glider pilots frequently use computer based maps showing approved turning points and controlled airspace for planning cross-country flights.

Commercial programs are available for the purpose, but  run only on Windows.  Maintenance of airspace and turning point data has to be done at client level.

*jsTaskPlan* is a viewer written in JavaScript and HTML 5, which will  run in any modern Web browser. It makes use of the [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).
 
 There is a production version, named "xcwebplan".  This may be viewed at http://glidingweb.org.
 
 The user plans the task interactively by clicking on marker icons on the map.

 Currently it is only useable on larger screens (1100 px plus width) with a conventional mouse.  It is intended to add touchscreen and tablet support as a further development.

jsTaskPlan has been tested in the following browsers:
* Firefox 42  (Windows and Linux versions)
* Chromium 45 on Linux
*Chrome 46 on Windows
*Microsoft Edge
* Internet Explorer 11
