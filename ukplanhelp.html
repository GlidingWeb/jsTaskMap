            XCWebPlan is a web based application for planning cross-country glider flights.
        </p>
        <p>
             XCWebPlan runs on a wide range of devices and operating systems; all you need is an internet connection and a browser with
            Javascript enabled.  There is a universal edition, which can be used for flights anywhere in the world, but requires the user to load his own waypoint file.  This is a special edition designed for UK users which comes with the standard BGA turning point list loaded.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although designed to be as intuitive as possible, the program has one or two features you might miss, so please read this
            if you haven't used it before.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>
        As soon as you've cleared the airspace disclaimer, the BGA turning points will load and a marker will display on each point.  How long this takes will depend on both the power of your hardware and the speed of your internet connection.  Once they've loaded, zoom in on the area of the map you are interested in.
         </p>
        <h2>Altering the display</h2>
        <p>
            You can move around and zoom in or out on the map- if you've ever used Google Earth it works the same way. Click and drag
            to move; zoom in using the "+-"  bottom right, scroll wheel, or on a tablet, "pinching". To reduce clutter you can
            control the airspace clip altitude, or lose the airspace display altogether. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Once the waypoint file has loaded, you will also see two pairs of radio buttons, which you can use to show or hide waypoint markers, and also to turn on or off labels showing the waypoint trigraph.  On load, by default, markers are visible, but the labels are not.  Whatever the label setting, the full name of the waypoint will be displayed when you hover over it with the mouse.
        </p>
        <p>
         Depending how powerful your hardware is,  you may find response a bit sluggish with a large number of labels on screen.  In that case, if you are viewing at low zoom levels you may find it helpful to turn the labels off while moving around.  To avoid clutter and slowing down of the system, regardless of setting, no more than 400 labels will be shown at once.
        </p>

        <h2>Entering the task</h2>
        <p>
            Simply click on a waypoint marker to add it to the task- a text description will appear on the display to the right of the map.  Click on the buttons to the right of the this text to edit the task, "X" to remove the waypoint, the up arrow to move it up the list.  While doing this you will see the proposed task line displayed on the map, and you will be shown a calculated task length.
        </p>

        <h2>Printing (optional)</h2>
        <p>
           Buttons bottom right open pages for printing out either a briefing sheet (useful for local competitions) or a declaration.  In both cases obviously you will have to fill in some of the data yourself, but all the task data appears automatically. 
        </p>
        <p>
         One hint- even if you don't want to print anything, the briefing screen shows the "detail" entries in the waypoint file, which we couldn't fit in the main screen.
        </p>
        <h2>Airspace</h2>
        <p>
        The disclaimer is there for a reason.   We maintain the files as up to date as we can; our principal source of data is Geoff Brown's <a href="http://soaringweb.org/Airspace/UK/ASSelect.html" target="_blank">AS Select</a> program.   As pilots we have to deal with a number of variations of airspace, apart from the normal classes A to G we have to worry about parachute zones, military air traffic zones, transponder mandatory zones, radio mandatory zones  and prohibited and danger zones which may or may not have designated activity times and maybe or maybe not accessible with radio clearance.   Rather that try to cope with all that, we've provided you with some lines on the map which hopefully are the same as those on your chart, and credit you with knowing what you are doing.  Always check the chart before you fly!
